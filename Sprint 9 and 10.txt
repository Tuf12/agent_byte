# Sprint 9 & 10: Continuous Action Space + Performance Profiling

## Sprint 9: Continuous Action Space Support

### Current Limitation
- Interface only supports discrete actions: `step(action: int)`
- No support for continuous control tasks like robotics, physics simulations

### 9.1 Enhanced Environment Interface

**File**: `core/interfaces.py` (MODIFY EXISTING)

**Changes**:
- Add action space type detection
- Support both discrete and continuous actions
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 9.2 Action Space Adapters

**File**: `core/action_adapters.py` (NEW)

**Components**:
- `DiscreteToContiunousAdapter` - Convert discrete actions to continuous
- `ContinuousToDiscreteAdapter` - Discretize continuous spaces
- `HybridActionAdapter` - Handle mixed action spaces
- `ParameterizedActionAdapter` - Neural parameterized actions

### 9.3 Continuous Neural Networks

**File**: `core/continuous_network.py` (NEW)

**Implementation**:
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for continuous control
- Deterministic Policy Gradient methods
- Action bounds and normalization

### 9.4 Enhanced Dual Brain

**File**: `core/dual_brain.py` (MODIFY EXISTING)

**Enhancements**:
- Detect action space type
- Route to appropriate network (discrete/continuous)
- Handle action space adaptation

## Sprint 10: Performance Profiling System

### Current Gap
- No performance monitoring or bottleneck identification
- Hard to optimize learning or transfer performance

### 10.1 Profiling Decorators

**File**: `utils/profiler.py` (NEW)

**Components**:
- `@profile_method` - Time function execution
- `@profile_memory` - Track memory usage
- `@profile_gpu` - Monitor GPU utilization

### 10.2 Performance Analytics

**File**: `analysis/performance_analyzer.py` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Bottleneck identification
- Learning curve analysis
- Transfer learning efficiency metrics
- System resource optimization recommendations

### 10.3 Real-time Monitoring

**File**: `utils/monitor.py` (NEW)

**Capabilities**:
- Live performance dashboard
- Automatic performance regression detection
- Training optimization suggestions

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Continuous Action Foundations (Days 1-3)

**Priority 1**: Extend interfaces for continuous actions
**Priority 2**: Create basic action adapters
**Priority 3**: Implement SAC-based continuous network

### Week 2: Performance Profiling (Days 4-5)

**Priority 1**: Add profiling decorators throughout codebase
**Priority 2**: Create performance analyzer for bottleneck detection
**Priority 3**: Build monitoring dashboard

### Week 3: Integration & Testing (Days 6-7)

**Priority 1**: Integration testing with continuous control environments
**Priority 2**: Performance regression testing
**Priority 3**: Documentation and examples

## Expected Benefits

### Sprint 9 Benefits:
1. **Expanded Environment Support**: Work with robotics, physics, and control tasks
2. **Better Action Resolution**: More precise control in complex environments
3. **Transfer Learning**: Skills can transfer between discrete and continuous spaces

### Sprint 10 Benefits:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix bottlenecks automatically
2. **Training Efficiency**: Faster convergence and resource usage
3. **Transfer Analysis**: Understand which transfers work best and why

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- `core/action_adapters.py`
- `core/continuous_network.py`
- `utils/profiler.py`
- `analysis/performance_analyzer.py`
- `utils/monitor.py`
- `examples/continuous_control_example.py`

### Modified Files:
- `core/interfaces.py` (enhance Environment interface)
- `core/dual_brain.py` (add continuous action support)
- `core/agent.py` (add profiling hooks)
- `core/neural_brain.py` (support continuous networks)

### Files Unchanged:
