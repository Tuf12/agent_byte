# Agent Byte v3.0 - Part 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Part 2 focuses on addressing critical implementation gaps and architectural concerns identified in the code review. This plan organizes the work into focused sprints to ensure systematic improvements while maintaining the modular, environment-agnostic design.

## Sprint 1: Neural Network PyTorch Migration (Week 1)

### Objectives
- Replace numpy-based StandardizedNetwork with PyTorch implementation
- Enable actual gradient-based learning
- Maintain compatibility with existing interfaces

### Question Asked
Neural Network Implementation
The StandardizedNetwork class has placeholders for actual learning:
# Line in neural_brain.py:
# Update network weights (simplified)
# In a real implementation, this would involve proper backpropagation
Are you planning to implement the actual backpropagation, or integrate with PyTorch/TensorFlow?
The current implementation won't actually update the network weights

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Create PyTorch Network Module
- **File**: `core/network.py`
- Implement `StandardizedNetwork` as `nn.Module`
- Architecture:
  ```
  Input (256) → Linear(512) → LeakyReLU → Linear(256) → LeakyReLU → 
  Linear(128) → LeakyReLU → Linear(64) → LeakyReLU → Linear(action_size)
  ```
- Include dropout layers for regularization
- Implement proper weight initialization (Xavier/He)

#### 1.2 Update NeuralBrain Learning
- **File**: `core/neural_brain.py`
- Implement actual DQN/DDQN learning with PyTorch
- Add proper loss computation (MSE/Huber)
- Implement gradient clipping
- Add optimizer (Adam) with learning rate scheduling

#### 1.3 Update State Management
- Modify `get_state_dict()` to use `model.state_dict()`
- Modify `load_state_dict()` to use `model.load_state_dict()`
- Update storage to handle PyTorch tensors
- Ensure CPU/GPU compatibility for saving/loading

### Deliverables
- Functional PyTorch network with actual learning

In state_normalizer.py, the dimensional reduction/expansion could lose critical information:

When reducing from >256 dims, using evenly spaced sampling might miss important features
Consider using PCA or autoencoders for better dimensionality reduction?
### Tasks

Consider making the applicability conditions more data-driven?

NeuralBrain patterns inform symbolic decisions
Need careful initialization order

### 8. Configuration Management Enhancement

- Add config validation
- Implement config inheritance
- Create config migration tools
- 
### Question Asked
8. Configuration Management
While config.py exists, many modules use hard-coded values from constants.py:

Should configuration be more centralized?
Environment-specific configs might be needed despite being "agnostic"

### 9. Continuous Action Space Support
- Implement Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for continuous control

if action == 0:
    return np.array([low])
elif action == 1:
    return np.array([(low + high) / 2])
This won't work well for complex continuous control
Consider parameterized action spaces?
